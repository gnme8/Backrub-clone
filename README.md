BackRub clone - is a clone of the old version of the Google website, when it was still called "BackRub". 
You can use this source code on your google evolution website or something like that. 

P.S. The project has not yet been finalized, or rather the file "backrub.html" has not been finalized. After all, I (gnme8) made this website from scratch on my own, without copying the html code anywhere, just looking for BackRub pictures on the Internet to do everything exactly.
